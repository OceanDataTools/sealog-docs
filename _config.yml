  Sealog is a general purpose event logging framework built to support research
  vessels and deployed underwater vehicles. It provides vessel/vehicle
  operators with an event-logging solution that can be customized to support
  the operatorâ€™s unique needs and provide a science party with a tool that
  allows them to design and enforce standardized documenting procedures and
  vocabularies.
