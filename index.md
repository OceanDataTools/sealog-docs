Sealog is a general purpose event logging framework built to support research vessels and underwater vehicles.

It provides vessel/vehicle operators with an event-logging solution that can be customized to support the operatorâ€™s unique needs and provide a science party with a tool that allows them to design and enforce standardized documenting procedures and vocabularies.
